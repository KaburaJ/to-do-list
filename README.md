This repository contains a to-do list that I created using `react`. It is based off of a comination of techniques that have acquired over the past week. It is a good start in my eyes and I wish to grow even further than that in future. <br><br>My web app can be accessed [here](https://kaburaj.github.io/to-do-list/)
